# Game_Server

Hi, my name is Steven and this game server (and game) is a project for a technical assessment.

The client folder was provided by the company and I coded the app.js file.

# Description of the Game (copied from the documentation): 

The Game

A connect-the-dots game for two players.

# Definitions

• octilinear line - a horizontal, vertical, or 45° diagonal line

# Rules

• The game is played on a 4x4 grid of 16 nodes.

• Players take turns drawing octilinear lines connecting nodes.

• Each line must begin at the start or end of the existing path, so that all lines form a continuous path.

• The first line may begin on any node.

• A line may connect any number of nodes.

• Lines may not intersect.

• No node can be visited twice.

• The game ends when no valid lines can be drawn.

• The player who draws the last line is the loser.
